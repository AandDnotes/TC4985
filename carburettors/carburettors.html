                <h1>Carburettors</h1>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_4119.jpg" style="width: 480px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">In September 2018, when I removed the head of the engine, I had to remove the carburettors in order to remove the manifolds. So I though that I should at least partially strip them down to check that the needles were fully seated and to clean out the float chambers. The first thing that I discovered was that there are no springs on the pistons! I've read that people have used springs of different strengths or no spring at all, but wondered if this was the cause of 'jumping' due to my heavy foot when going over bumps. However, subsequent runs showed a marked reduction in this effect, due to what I'm not sure.</p>
                <p>I also discovered that the float needle in the rear carburettor had been put in upside down and the float lever bent to compensate. This diagram from 'Tuning SU Carburetters (1968), although showing the float and chamber top upside down, illustrates that the gap between the float and the top should be 1/8" to 3/16". So I adjusted it accordingly.</p>

                <img src="images/DSC_4113.jpg" style="width: 480px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px"></p>
                <p>I cleaned all the parts in petrol, without disturbing the link between the two carburettors and hopefully the synchronisation. I replaced fibre washers on the fuel inlets and on the float chamber attachments and new gaskets around the top of the float chambers. During a couple of runs (21 miles and 42 miles) the engine ran well, although the plugs were still too sooty and there was a fuel leak from the jet assembly of the front carburettor. So I decided to remove the front carburettor and strip down the jet assembly.</p>
                <p><img src="images/jetAssembly.png" style="height: 480px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px"><img src="images/IMG_0244.jpg" style="width: 360px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 0px"><img src="images/IMG_0242.jpg" style="width: 470px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px">The first photo shows the jet assembly before removing it from the carburettor and the second photo shows the parts that I found. The diagram, taken from a 2007 edition of the Anglo Parts catalogue (page 22), shows what should be present. Actually items 32 and 33 are together in the photo, as are items 27 and 28 and items 25 and 26. For some reason I did not put the main retaining nut (item 24) in the photo. However, you can see that the lower pair of items 29 and 30 are missing. Also, the top cork gland (item 29) was very hard, as was the cork washer (item 26). In fact the brass spacer and the cork washer (items 25 and 26) were loose on the original assembly and could be rotated easily with the fingers.</p>
                <p>Luckily I had one set of cork washers and a spare dished washer (item 30) and so was able to replace these. I also cleaned the lower end of the jet (item 20) so that it would go fully through the mixture adjusting nut (item 22).</p>
                <p>The only problem I had replacing the carburettor was connecting the slow-running cable. The bolt through which the cable passes broke on one side of the hole. I drilled a hole in another bolt, but that also broke! I must have been over-tightening the nut. The third attempt, using half a junction block connector above and below the bolt, worked. Again I set the mixture nut to six flats down and the engine started easily and ran well.</p>
                <p>Later, when doing the compression tests mentioned above, I had cause to remove the plugs. Those on cylinders 1 &amp; 2 looked better (less sooty), but those in cylinders 3 &amp; 4 were still sooty. So I made the mixture for the rear carburettor leaner by two flats. It is now at four flats from the top.</p>
                <h2>Fuel Level</h2>
                <p>
                On June 21st 2020, as COVID-19 pandemic lockdown measures were starting to be eased, I decided that I would have another try at setting the fuel level in the two carburettors. According to an article by F.E. Old, called ‘BACK TO BASICS #11: CARBURETOR TUNING’ and published at some unknown date in 'The Sacred Octagon', the fuel level should be approximately 3/8" below the top of the jet. On the rear carburettor I couldn't see the fuel in the jet, which is probably as it should be, but in the front carburettor the fuel was at the top of the jet. Since I get 'sooty' rear plugs I had expected it to be the other way around.</p>
                <p><img src="images/floatLever.png" style="width: 300px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 20px 20px">Old says that, since you can't easily measure the fuel height in the jet, the measurement is transferred to the distance of the float lever from the underside of the float chamber top. As you can see from the diagram, where the top of the float chamber is upside down, the distance should be 7/16" (or 11.1mm) when the lever is resting on the fuel valve. Luckily I was able to find a long 7/16" Witworth bolt to use as a measure.</p>
                <p><img src="images/IMG_0801small.jpg" style="width: 470px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px">I also found on the front carburettor that the flat portion of the lever was very bent, so I straightened it and adjusted it. That on the rear carburettor was not as bad, but I needed to set that also.</p>
                <p>Until I try running the car the only test that I could do was to check that I now couldn't see fuel in either of the jets.</p>
