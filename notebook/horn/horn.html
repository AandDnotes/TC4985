                <h1>Lucus Altette Horn</h1>
                <p>The original horn on the TC does not work and is not wired up. However, there is a cheap plastic horn installed under the bonnet so as to make it legal.</p>
                <p>I found the following document on a classic motorcycle site.</p>
                <embed src="images/Horn.pdf" style="width:950px; height:1000px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;">
                <p>In spite of following the dismantling instructions in the above document, I could not get the diaphragm and armature assembly out. Having removed the bezel, the diaphragm is loose, but will not pull out and I can't get the nut undone that holds the armature to the diaphragm.</p>
                <p>However, I measured the resistance of the coil as about 10 ohms, so it should be possible to get it working.</p>
