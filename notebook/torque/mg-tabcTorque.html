<p><b><em>The following thoughts are offered by Carl Cederstrand, a well known M.G. enthusiast and life-long engineer.</em></b></p>
<p>I would like to add a comment on tightening head bolts. Measuring the torque is Donald Duck way of setting the clamping force. The torque varies with the smoothness of the threads and with any grease or oil on the threads. A better way is to set a dial indicator in contact with the top of the stud and then tighten the head nut until the stud is elongated by an amount that indicates the desired clamping force. This is the way it is done in Germany and it is a superior technique.</p>
<p>When tightening head studs on our T-Series use a torque wrench that has a dial indicator so that it gives a continuous torque reading. As one tightens the nut, the torque reading increases. Then suddenly the torque no longer increases as the nut is turned. Stop! You have reached the elastic limit of the stud. Further turning of the nut will only snap off the stud!</p>
<p>I always limit the torque I apply on the head nuts to 90% of the recommended factory value. The factory suggested value does NOT allow for the smoothing of the threads that occurs with use. The 90% value has worked fine for me for decades.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
