                <p>The following notes were posted by Norman Verona and Ian Thomson on the mg-tabc group on 27/28 July 2016.</p>

                <p>I've set the toe-in to the manual spec. I think it was 1/16th toe in (from memory, maybe wrong).</p>
                <p>I do this by putting two bars across the front and rear of the car at wheel centre height then a fine string down both sides and measure the toe-in (out) from the string to the tyre centre.</p>

                <p>At the risk of teaching you to suck eggs you have to allow for any run-out on the wheels when doing this.  Modern steel wheels can normally be trusted to be true but our wire wheels are almost bound to be a bit out and that can make a difference when setting th tracking. To allow for this it is necessary when doing this to mark the tyres to ensure that measurements are taken at the same tyre position front and back.  One side must be measured and then the whole car must be rolled forward or backward by half a wheel turn before taking the other.  It is surprising how frustrating this can be as the measurements can change each time you repeat them just to check.</p>
