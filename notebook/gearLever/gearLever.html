                <p><img src="images/CIMG0751.JPG" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px; box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px grey;">The following is from John Boocock on the mg-tabc group on 2nd July 2016.</p>
                <p>~~~~~~~~~~</p>
                <p>Here is a summary of what I will do on TC7142 as a consequence of the feedbackThanks to all who replied to my call for help in removing my gear lever. With the combined wisdom of the group I got the pins out and for future reference will describe how it was achieved.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Firstly remove the gearbox lid.</li>
                    <li>With an 8mm end mill remove the aluminium peeded over the end of the pins.</li>
                    <li>Grind the end of a piece of 4.0 - 4.5mm hardened steel bar to a screwdriver point.</li>
                    <li>Apply penetrating oil to the ends of the pins and heat the end of the alumunium gearbox extension with a hot air gun to about 50 - 60 degrees C.</li>
                    <li>Wearing a pair of gloves tap the  sharpened bar down between the pin and the ball of the gear lever until the pin becomes free.</li>
                    <li>As you can see from the picture the head of the pin is  mushroom shaped hence the need to remove the peened over aluminium.</li>
                    <li>The pins are 5mm diameter with a 7mm diameter head and are 19mm long.</li>
                </ol>
