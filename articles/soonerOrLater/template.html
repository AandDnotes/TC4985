        <h1>It had to happen sooner or later</h1>
        <p>It was a misty morning, but Angela and I arrived at Whiteways Lodge in TC4985 at eight o'clock, having driven the 14 miles from Steyning, only to find that most of the work had already been done. So we donned our hi-vis vests and started directing the incoming MG that were starting to trickle in. As the morning progressed, the sun burnt its way through the mist and the forecast fine day was with us. Luckily the number of cars leaving to start the run balanced those still arriving by about ten and by 10:30, and after finding a suitable bush, we set of on the SDR route, heading for Eastbourne.</p>
