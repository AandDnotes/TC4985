        <h1>It had to happen sooner or later!</h1>
        <p>It was a misty morning, but Angela and I arrived at Whiteways Lodge in TC4985 at eight o'clock, having driven the 14 miles from Steyning, only to find that most of the setting-up had already been done by the other volunteers. So we donned our hi-vis vests and started directing the incoming MGs that were starting to trickle in. As the morning progressed, the sun burnt its way through the mist and the forecast fine day was with us. Luckily the number of cars leaving Whiteways to start the run balanced those still arriving by about ten and so by 10:30, and after finding a suitable bush, we set off on the SDR route, heading for Eastbourne. There was no South Downs Run in 2020, of course, and we had missed the 2019 run due to visiting our daughter and her family, who were then living in California. So our last run had been in 2018.</p>
        <p>A little over 20 miles from the start, on the B2133 heading for Ashington, I detected a slight 'stammering' of the engine, a series of short 'hiccups' and then all would be fine. On the short stretch of the A24 and then again on the A283, heading for Bramber, we had similar problems. WE could have gone home to investigate the problem, but I decided to stop at the Castle Inn Hotel in Bramber for coffee and to examine the engine. After refreshments the under bonnet area had cooled down a bit and I turned on the ignition. The usual 'tick' of the fuel pump remained fast, suggesting a sticking diaphragm, so I hit the fuel pump a couple of times with a large spanner (apparently a standard remedy) and all seemed well. The engine started easily and ticked over well. So full of confidence we set of again in the direction of Eastbourne.</p>

I 'nursed' the car through Ditchling and Barcombe and we reached the A22. Due to the road works at the Drusilas roundabout on the A27 causing long delays, we had been advised to continue down the A22 to Polegate and then turn back along the A27 before turning into Wilmington. So we continued down the A22, with the problem getting more severe by the mile. As we approached the Bowship roundabout there was a sign to 'services', so we pulled into an area that had a petrol station, shops and cafe, as well as a Travelodge. As we entered so we saw an RAC patrol man talking with some other travellers. We parked in a shaded spot and, being RAC members, I ask for assistance. He was very obliging and he checked the usual suspects; fuel pump, distributor cap, rotor arm and contact points. All seemed fine, but when he had re-assembled the distributor the engine would not start!</p>
        <p>So we only managed 60 miles of the 80 mile run.</p>
        <p>Contact points spring in wrong position. Fuel vaporisation?</p>
