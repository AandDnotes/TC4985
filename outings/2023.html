          <p><img class="med" src="images/DriveItDay2023.jpg">I collected Angela from outside the Methodist Church (in the drizzle) and we drove to Parham House for the WSMGOC Drive It Day run. We were a little late, but there was quite a good turnout, with most people sheltering under the gazebo. After a while the rain eased and we all went into the garden. We took our lunch with us and found a quite, sheltered spot to eat it. Then we wandered around the garden and part of the grounds. Some people also went into the house.</p>
          <p>The run, there and back, was only 20 miles.</p>

          <p>So far this year, the weather hasn't been kind and when it was fine we were doing something else! Therefore, up till now the runs have mainly been test runs or local visits, apart form 'Drive It Day' when we went to Parham House (and it rained).</p>
          <p>Today, however, I took the TC on a Wanderers run. Due to the weather, David F-B and I went on the last run in his TR4A. Although the forecast was for showers, the sun was shining this morning and I drove to Lyminster to pick up David and then we went on to Denmans Gardens at Fontwell to meet up with the other Wanderers. That was 25 miles, then we did a 30 mile run, with lots of twists and turns, to Chichester Yacht Club for lunch. Of course, I then had to take David home and return home myself. I drove a total of 92 miles and the car ran well. We had the hood down until we got to the yacht club. It was starting to drizzle as we arrived, so the hood went up. We kept the hood up on the way back, although it didn't start raining until I left David's.</p>
          <p>Overall, a good, but tiring outing.</p>
