          <h2 id="SW0416">Sussex Wanderers April, Run to West Chiltington</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0459.jpg">On Tuesday 12th April 2016, the first outing of the year for the Sussex Wanderers started at Shoreham Airport. A number of cars parked in front of the art deco terminal building while we went in for coffee. My TC is on the right. Overall there were about 15 cars that then made their way up Annington Road, down Maudlin Lane, around Bramber, through Small Dole, right at Woods Mill and on through Blackstone, through Partridge Green, up to the A24 and through Dial Post, ending up at West Chiltington where we had a good lunch in the Queen's Head. It was a fine, sunny day, with another TC, two TAs and a 'special' of some form.</p>

          <h2 id="DID2016">Drive-It Day</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0465.jpg">Sunday 19th April 2016 was the national Drive-It Day and the West Sussex MG Owners Club organised a run. We met at Cootham for coffee and then drove down small back roads to Elsted, south west of Midhurst. Many of us, who were in a convoy, decided that the 'farm track' we were on was wrong and so turned around. It was the first time that I had driven the TC in a ploughed field! It seems that we were on the right road, but we followed someone's satnav and got to Elsted.</p>
          <p>I took Brandon as my navigator, his first ride in the car. We had the roof down from Cootham to Elsted and did a total of 70 miles; the furthest in a single day so far.</p>
          <p>The photo shows some of the cars in the pub car park at Cootham.</p>

          <p>On Monday 9th May 2016 the West Sussex MG Owners Club held it's 'Run for Supper'. The supper being fish &amp; chips. We met at Washington and then followed a route that took about an hour and ended up at Worthing Rugby Club, the normal venue. Angela navigated and we did a total of 48 miles, returning in the dark. There was light rain on the way to the Rugby Club, but it had stopped by the time that we travelled home.</p>

          <h2 id="SW0516">Sussex Wanderers May, Run to Warnham</h2>
          <p>The following Wednesday (11th May) was the monthly Sussex Wanderers run. I was on my own this time, so had to follow someone else. We met at Billys on the Road, on the A29 just north of Billingshurst, and followed a 25 mile route, down some very narrow lanes, to Warnham, just off the A24 north of Horsham. There was quite persistent rain on the way to the start, but some of us had the roof down for the main run, only getting a little wet. I also had the hood down on the way home, doing a total of 65 miles. The car got quite dirty!</p>

          <h2 id="SW0816">Sussex Wanderers August, Run to Balls Cross</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0534.jpg">It's almost three months since I went on a Sussex Wanderers run due to the work that I did on the stub axles and spindles. However, today (Wednesday 10th August) I took the TC to the RSPV nature reserve and Pulborough Brooks to meet up with about another 17 MGs. Bob, who owns an MGA that is currently out of action, came in his Seat and so offered to navigate for me. So after coffee and a chat we set off for Balls Cross via Wisborough Green, a run of 25 miles.</p>
          <p><img class="left" src="images/DSC_0537.jpg">The weather was fine and it was a good run. Surprisingly no one caught us, but a lot of cars arrived only a minute or two later. After lunch in the garden we returned via Petworth to Pulborough Brooks, where I dropped off Bob, and then I returned home, a total of 59 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SDR2016">South Downs Run</h2>
          <p><img src="images/map.png">The time came around for the big event of the year; the South Downs Run. On the morning of Sunday 4th September 2016 we set off in the MG and drove to a cafe above Arundel (just off Whiteways roundabout), which was the start of the run (organised by the West Sussex MG Owners Club). We left there at about 9:30 and followed a route (that went through Bramber and along the lee side of the Downs) to Eastbourne, 84 miles by our trip meter.</p>

          <img class="med" src="images/DSC_0547.jpg">
          <p>About 200 MGs took part in the run. As you can see, quite a few cars were at Whiteways when we arrived. The photo of us setting off on the run from Whiteways was given to me by the editor of the WSMGOC Main Gear magazine.</p>

          <p><img class="med" src="images/JAD0313small.jpg">This photo of us driving down into Birling Gap was taken from 'A Tootle Along the South Downs' (no longer available on the web) in Spoke magazine.</p>
          <p>We stopped at the Castle Hotel in Bramber for coffee and then arrived in Eastbourne at one o'clock. After eating our packed lunch on the promenade and walking along to the pier and back, we left at 3:15 and arrived home, having driven along the coast road through Newhaven and Brighton, just before five.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="run">
          <p><img class="med" src="images/DSC_0557.jpg">We did a total of 134 miles, with the hood down all the way. It was overcast and not particularly warm, but it stayed dry. When we got home we were very weary.</p>

          <h2 id="SW0916">Sussex Wanderers September, Run to the Bluebell Railway</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0562croppedsmall.jpg">On September 14th the Sussex Wanderers met at The Orchard, a cafe at West Grinstead, just east of the Buckbarn crossroads on the A272 (about 10 miles north of home). After coffee and a chat we left for a 28 mile run, down some very narrow roads, to the Bluebell Railway Sheffield Park Station. There must have been about 20 cars.</p>
          <p>Most people had booked a train ride with lunch, but a few of us had lunch in the station cafe and just looked around. I then took the scenic route home via Ditching, doing a total of 66 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SW1016">Sussex Wanderers October, Run to Goodwood</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0572.jpg">About 25 MGs (and an Aston Martin) gathered on October 19th at the Queen's Head in West Chiltington for coffee and a chat. Again I was on my own and so arranged to follow another T-series that had a navigator and from there we set off for Goodwood. On the way clearly some people took a wrong turn, since MGs appeared from all directions!</p>
          <p>When we arrived at Goodwood, having travelled down some very narrow lanes, some very fast cars were queuing in the pit lane and being let out every ten seconds to do a 'sprint' lap. We then lined up on the starting grid and did four 'parade' laps. In other words, we followed a safety car in single file at a fairly sedate speed around the track. This was a little dissapointing.</p>
          <p>Afterwards we had lunch in the old control tower cafe next to the track. Although the journey from West Chiltington to Goodwood was 27 miles, I did a total of 77 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SW1116">Sussex Wanderers November, Run into Surrey</h2>
          <p>This month's Sussex Wanderers run took us into Surrey. We met at the Newbridge Nurseries (in the Stooks cafe) at Broadbridge Heath for coffee and a chat. As usual I had to follow someone and so asked Brian and his 'lady friend'. Since they got lost trying to find the garden centre I should have been warned. En route they went wrong three times, the first after only 1&#189; miles!</p>
          <p>From Broadbridge Heath we took a convoluted route around north Sussex and south Surrey, finishing at The Parrot at Furnace Green. There had been a lot of rain over night and, although it had stopped, there was a lot of spray and mud on the roads. The Parrot was very good and we had 42 people there for lunch. Afterwards, I took a more direct route home, straight down to Broadbridge Heath, down the A24 and through Partridge Green. I got home at 3:15 having done a total of 76 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SW1216">Sussex Wanderers December, Run for Christmas Lunch</h2>
          <p><img src="images/DSC_0577.jpg">This time Angela was able to join me on the MG run. We met the other MG drivers at Camelia Botnar, north of Partridge Green, for coffee. Then a 30 mile round about run to the Red Lion at Ashington for lunch. It was a good run and a good lunch, particularly since I won the first raffle prize of a bottle of prosecco! Also the weather was sunny (between rainy and overcast days) and so we had the hood down all the way. As you can see in the photo (taken at the Red Lion), some people wore Christmas atire.</p>
          <p>We were home by about 3:30, having done a total of 51 miles. The flasher unit stopped working part way, so I have some repairs to do.</p>
