          <p>Normally this run would not justify an entry in these pages. However, under a clear blue sky and with little wind, I took the TC out for the first trip of the year. I only did 17 miles; up through Ashurst to Partridge Green and back down through Henfield. It took a while for the engine to warm up (there is no thermostat fitted), but it ran well. The only problem was the sun in my eyes on the way back south.</p>

          <p><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0060.jpg"><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0061.jpg">This was the first Pub Run since before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. It was a fine, relatively sunny day, with a good turnout. There were 22 people and about ten MGs (plus a few other, more modern, makes). We had a good lunch, with plenty of chat, mainly about places, holidays and families.</p>
          <p>We took the smoother, main roads to Patching, but with the hood down, and arrived home at three thirty having done 25 miles.</p>
