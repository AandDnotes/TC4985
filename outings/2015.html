                <h2 id="VSCC">VSCC Gathering at Dial Post, August</h2>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_0347.jpg">Two friends have classic cars and so I arranged to meet them on Friday 21st August 2015 for lunch at the VSCC gathering at the Crown Inn at Dial Post. Angela came with me and from there we went back to the house of one of the friends before returning home; a total of 26 miles. This photo shows some of the cars that gathered in Dial Post.</p>
                <p>It was after this outing that I started dismantling the radiator so as to get at the rusting radiator bottom bracket.</p>

                <h2 id="SDR2015">South Downs Run, September</h2>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_0348.jpg"><img src="images/DSC_0349.jpg">The MG South Downs Run was held on Sunday 6th September 2015, before I had finished putting my MG back together. In any case, the 100+ miles round trip was further than I would have undertaken at this stage. So I volunteered to act as a steward at the event. It was a fine day, which seemed to go well. These two photos show the smaller group of pre-56 cars and the bulk of the MGs.</p>

                <h2 id="SW1115">Sussex Wanderers November, Run to Handcross</h2>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_0378.jpg">The Sussex Wanderers are a group of MG owners who are members of either the MG Car Club or the Octagon Club and go on monthly runs from April to December. I had been away for the October run, but on Wednesday 11th November 2015 we met at the Sportsman pub (for coffee) at Goddards Green, about 12 miles from home via Small Dole and Hurstpierpoint, and drove, via a network of country lanes, to the Red Lion at Handcross for lunch. Since I had no navigator, I and a TA driver followed another TA driver who did have a navigator. An excellent day covering a total of 52 miles. This photo was taken at the Sportsman pub. there were a total of about 20 MGs.</p></article>

                <h2 id="SW1215">Sussex Wanderers December, Run to Dial Post</h2>
                <p><img src="images/DSC_0390.jpg">David, the Sussex Wanderers organiser, arranged another run on Wednesday 9th December 2015. We met at the Camelia Botna garden centre (for coffee) and then drove along muddy lanes (going past the Balcombe railway viaduct) to the Crown Inn at Dial Post for Christmas lunch. Another excellent run, with a total of 46 miles covered. The photo shows some of the cars meeting at the garden centre. This time there were only two T-Series.</p>
