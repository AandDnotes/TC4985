          <p><img class="med" src="images/lockdown.jpg">Due to the current Covid-19 restrictions, the last time that I took the TC out for a run was in November last year. On Wednesday 14th April I had to deliver something to Victoria Grand and the sun was shining. So I started the TC and drove down to Lancing, along the coast through Worthing and up to Victoria Grand. Having delivered the documents and waved to Dad from his window, I drove up to Washington and back home. A total of 26 miles. It was wonderful. The only down-side was that the carburettors were leaking fuel!</p>
