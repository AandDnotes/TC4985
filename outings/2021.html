          <p><img class="med" src="images/lockdown.jpg">Due to the current Covid-19 restrictions, the last time that I took the TC out for a run was in November last year. On Wednesday 14th April I had to deliver something to Victoria Grand and the sun was shining. So I started the TC and drove down to Lancing, along the coast through Worthing and up to Victoria Grand. Having delivered the documents and waved to Dad from his window, I drove up to Washington and back home. A total of 26 miles. It was wonderful. The only down-side was that the carburettors were leaking fuel!</p>

          <h2 id="CB0421">Camelia Botna</h2>
          <p>Another sunny day with hardly a breath of wind. So we decided to go to Camelia Botna for morning coffee and to look around the plant nursery. We went via Ashurst and then returned via Henfield, arriving home just in time to prepare lunch after a round trip of 21 miles. The TC ran well, although the tick-over was a little high. So later in the afternoon I did some adjustments. In spite of having tightened the bolts on the carburettors, a few had worked loose again.</p>
