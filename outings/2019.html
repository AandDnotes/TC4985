                <p><img src="images/stable-wide-web.jpg">This was my first run in the TC for 2019. It was a cold and grey day on Wednesday 23rd when I set off just after eleven o'clock so I put the hood up. The sun came out en route, but it stayed cold. Nineteen people met at the pub and we had a good lunch and natter. There and back was a total of 52 miles and the TC ran well, in spite of using petrol contaminated with diesel.</p>

                <p><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0376.JPG"><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0377.JPG">Having got the engine to run, even with a small amount of diesel still in the tank, we took a trip to Nymans on Friday 15th. As you can see from the photo it was a beautiful day, so we had lunch and then went for a walk in the woods. The round trip was 36 miles and the car ran well. We arrived home at twenty to four, after a good day out.</p>

                <h2 id="PR0219">WSMGOC Pub Run to the Bat &amp; Ball, February</h2>
                <p><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0382.JPG"><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0384.JPG">It was a grey, misty start to the day on Friday 22nd. Angela walked down to the butchers and the library before we set off in the MG. She delivered some paper flowers that she had made while I put some petrol in the tank. We then drove to Billingshurt, to the Bat &amp; Ball for the WSMGOC pub run. While we were there th sun came out.</p>
                <p>It was a good meal and interesting company. As we were leaving so a hot air balloon was inflated and launched from the field adjacent to the car park. We all then went 100 yards down the road to Milestone Classics to look around their garage. Of the 15+ cars, some were sold, some for sale and some being worked on. It was a good day out, but a surprisingly short run at only 34 miles.</p>
