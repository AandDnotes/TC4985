          <p><img src="images/stable-wide-web.jpg">This was my first run in the TC for 2019. It was a cold and grey day on Wednesday 23rd when I set off just after eleven o'clock so I put the hood up. The sun came out en route, but it stayed cold. Nineteen people met at the pub and we had a good lunch and natter. There and back was a total of 52 miles and the TC ran well, in spite of using petrol contaminated with diesel.</p>

          <p><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0376.JPG"><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0377.JPG">Having got the engine to run, even with a small amount of diesel still in the tank, we took a trip to Nymans on Friday 15th. As you can see from the photo it was a beautiful day, so we had lunch and then went for a walk in the woods. The round trip was 36 miles and the car ran well. We arrived home at twenty to four, after a good day out.</p>

          <h2 id="PR0219">WSMGOC Pub Run to the Bat &amp; Ball, February</h2>
          <p><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0382.JPG"><img class="small" src="images/IMG_0384.JPG">It was a grey, misty start to the day on Friday 22nd. Angela walked down to the butchers and the library before we set off in the MG. She delivered some paper flowers that she had made while I put some petrol in the tank. We then drove to Billingshurt, to the Bat &amp; Ball for the WSMGOC pub run. While we were there th sun came out.</p>
          <p>It was a good meal and interesting company. As we were leaving so a hot air balloon was inflated and launched from the field adjacent to the car park. We all then went 100 yards down the road to Milestone Classics to look around their garage. Of the 15+ cars, some were sold, some for sale and some being worked on. It was a good day out, but a surprisingly short run at only 34 miles.</p>

          <h2 id="SW0319">Sussex Wanderers Lunch, March - Dial Post</h2>
          <p><img class="small" src="images/TheCrown.jpg">The Sussex Wanderers don't usually meet until April, but by popular request it was decided to meet for lunch, rather than a full run. There were about 50 people, mostly arriving in non-MGs, but, although quite windy, it was dry with intermittent sunshine. So I took the TC. We had lunch at The Crown in Dial Post on Wednesday 13th. Consequently I was on my own, but I didn't need a navigator, Dial Post is only ten miles away, so I only did 20 miles all together. Leaving home just before twelve and getting back at three o'clock made for quite a good little outing. The TC was much admired.</p>

          <h2 id="PR0319">WSMGOC Pub Run to the Friar's Oak at Hassocks</h2>
          <p><img src="images/IMG_0432.JPG">Friday 29th March was a gloriously sunny and quite warm day, ideal for a run with the roof down. There were a few people at the pub when I arrived and we stood in the car park, in the sunshine, until most of the others had arrived. There was a good selection of MGs.</p>
          <p>I'd not ordered a meal, but the pub had lost the list, so we all had to wait a while. Our 'mens' table was quite lively and a good time was had by all. It was another fine run home, along the back of the Downs through Fulking, with a total of 25 miles driven.</p>

          <h2 id="SW0419">Sussex Wanderers, Barnes Green to Colgate</h2>
          <p><img src="images/IMG_0436.JPG">The first Sussex Wanderers run of the year started at The Queen's Head at Barnes Green, near Horsham for coffee. I then followed another TC down through Ashington, towards Wiston and along Spithandle Lane through Ashurst and Partridge Green before going through Mannings Heath and on to The Dragon at Colgate, a small village south of Crawley. This photo shows some of the 20+ MGs in the car park. We had a good lunch, if a little chaotic. I returned home via Pease Pottage, Handcross and Henfield. I drove a total of 74 miles and got home at three o'clock. Although cold, it stayed dry and was sunny from lunchtime onwards.</p>

          <h2 id="Amb0519">Lunch at Amberly</h2>
          <p>It had been a while since TC4985 had been for a run. Apart from the one mile trip from Kingsmead Close to Penlands Vale when we moved house, we had not been for a run since the April Wanderers outing. Although there was a May run, the weather was so wet that we decided to take the Panda, which was a pity since it was a good run from Denmans Gardens at Fontwell to the Chichester Yacht club for lunch (and then a sunny drive home). Today, Tuesday 21st May, however, was a glorious summer's day and so after Angela's dental appointment we went to the Sportsman Inn at Amberly for lunch, via Storrington so that Angela could bank her WI cash. The round trip was 50 miles.</p>
