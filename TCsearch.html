            It was in good condition, but had no history and the colour looked too pink and shiny. He also wanted £32,250, which I said was too much. He later reduced it.</p>
            <h2>TC3782 (13-10-1947) Advertised as 1948.</h2>

Coys put it in their 'True Greats' auction in December 2014 with estimated value of £20K-£25K, but it did not sell. (<a href="http://carphile.co.uk/seventy-classic-cars-sale-coys-true-greats-sale/">http://carphile.co.uk/seventy-classic-cars-sale-coys-true-greats-sale/</a>)<br>
So they put it in their 'Coys at Ascot' auction (16-05-15) and it failed to sell again! The estimate this time was £23K-£25K. Over e-mail they agreed that £22K would be an acceptable offer. However, when I went back to look at it again they said that they wanted more, so I left.</p>
            <h2>TC7166 (18-11-1948)</h2>

Brought back from the Netherlands. Front wings were showing signs of rust underneath and bubbling through on top. Seat runners missing. Hood in poor condition and would not fit on to windscreen pins. Originally he wanted £32,250 for it, but then reduced it to £29,750.</p>
